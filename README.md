# **A/B Testing Analysis â€“ Webpage Optimization**

## **By: Charvi Singh**

This project analyzes an **A/B test** to determine which webpage versionâ€”**Original (A) or Optimized (B)**â€”performs better in terms of **conversion rates and user engagement**. Using real-world data, we explore how factors like **time on page, device type, and traffic source** impact conversions.

## **Key Features**
âœ… **Data Cleaning & Exploration** â€“ Handle missing values, format data, and generate summary statistics.  
âœ… **Visualizations** â€“ Compare **conversion rates, user engagement trends, and traffic source impact** using **Seaborn & Matplotlib**.  
âœ… **Statistical Tests** â€“ Perform **Chi-Square and T-Test** to validate whether observed differences in conversion rates are statistically significant.  
âœ… **Actionable Insights** â€“ Identify the best-performing webpage version and factors influencing user behavior.  

## **Dataset Overview**
- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each user  
- **Group**: A/B test group (A = Original, B = Optimized)  
- **Time on Page**: How long a user stayed on the webpage  
- **Converted**: Whether the user completed a desired action (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
- **Device Type & Traffic Source**: Understand conversion patterns across platforms  

## **Results**
ðŸ“Œ **Group B (Optimized Page) outperformed Group A in conversions**  
ðŸ“Œ **Time spent on page has a significant effect on conversion likelihood**  
ðŸ“Œ **Device type and traffic source play a crucial role in user behavior**  
ðŸ“Œ **Statistical tests confirm that conversion rate differences are significant**  

## **Conclusion**
The **optimized webpage leads to higher user engagement and conversions**. The insights from this A/B test can help businesses improve their website design and marketing strategies.
